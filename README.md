Verbose
=======

With Verbose your character will feel more alive and integrated to Azeroth !
You can define sentences to say or emotes to do in reaction to game events :
casting a spell, receiving damage, speaking to a NPC...

**Note**: Since patch 8.2.5 (2019-09-24), there are limitations on messages automation in open world.
This means that Verbose will work flawlessly in instances,
but sadly in open world it needs a command or a key action to activate the speech.
Emotes work in every case, time to work on [Choosing your emote](https://fr.wowhead.com/user=Ozlem#guides) !

This addon is inspired by [SpeakinSpell](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/speakinspell) which seems not maintained any more.
